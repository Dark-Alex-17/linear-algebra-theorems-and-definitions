# Linear Algebra Theorems and Definitions

This repository houses LaTeX code and the corresponding generated PDF that generates a 
packet of linear algebra theorems and definitions as they appear in 
[Linear Algebra, 4th Edition by Stephen H. Friedberg, Arnold J. Insel, and Lawrence E. Spence](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-4th-Stephen-Friedberg/dp/0130084514). 
It is intended to serve as an easy reference of theorems and definitions for use when writing 
proofs or for just generic linear algebra properties.
